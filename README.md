# Palworld, 30-Day Event Bandaid
## _The bandaid we never knew we needed_

This bandaid is used to cure the 30-day event character data loss occuring in Palworld. When your characters hit 30 days old the game forgets who you are!!

- Step-1: Convert files to .json. Need to use the back-up from before the event happened, so unfortunately you're going to see a bit of a rollback but few hours better then <insert hours here>.
- Step-2: Change directory to the path with all your .jsons
- Step-3: Convert files back to .sav
- Step-4: Reimport to your server
- Step-5: Turn server on, confirm, create new backup for "After Event".
- Step-6: Repeat every 2 IRL days to be safe...

You do need to currently use a converter such as: https://gist.github.com/cheahjs/300239464dd84fe6902893b6b9250fd0

## Future Plans

- Make single script to do the conversion, time change, convert.
