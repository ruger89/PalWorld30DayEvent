Step-1: Convert files to .json. Need to use the back-up from before the event happened, so unfortunately you're going to see a bit of a rollback but few hours better then <insert hours here>.
Step-2: Change directory to the path with all your .jsons
Step-3: Convert files back to .sav
Step-4: Reimport to your server
Step-5: Turn server on, confirm, create new backup for "After Event".
Step-6: Repeat every 2 IRL days to be safe...

What this does: It resets the characters time to zero (brand-new) and still allows them to keep everything. No data loss in doing this.
